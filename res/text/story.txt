HOW IT BEGAN
YOU WERE AN EVIL  MONSTER BUT ALL YOUR
FRIENDS THOUGHT YOU WERE THAT ORDINARY
GUY. IDK HOW YOU GOT EVIL OR A MONSTER
BUT YOU NEED TO DO  EVIL THINGS FOR NO
REASON WHATSOEVER!

HOW TO PLAY
YOU CAN RUN AROUND USING WASD.
TO INTERACT PRESS SPACE.
TO STEAL THINGS PRESS E.

HOW TO PLAY
YOUR ATTENTION INDICATOR SHOULD ALWAYS
BE LOW!
YOUR NEED FOR DOING  BAD THINGS SHOULD
ALSO ALWAYS BE LOW!

HOW TO PLAY
IF ONE OF THE BARS REACHES THE MAXIMUM
YOU ARE GAME OVER! YOU HAVE TO BE EVIL
BECAUSE  I TELL YOU  TO! OTHERWISE  IT
WOULD BE BORING!

HOW TO PLAY
THE MORE EVIL YOU WERE DURING THE GAME,
THE  MORE POINTS  YOU WILL  GET IN THE
END!  THERE ARE  4 STAGES  YOU NEED TO
COMPLETE!

HOW TO PLAY
THERE IS  AN EVIL DEPOSIT BOX  IN EACH
SECTION. PUTTING THINGS IN RAISES YOUR
ATTENTION!  DESTROY  AS  MANY ORDINARY
THINGS AS YOU CAN! (BARRELS, FOOD, ETC)

HOW TO PLAY
PUTTING THINGS INTO  THE EVIL BOX ALSO
DECREASES THE NEED  TO DO EVIL THINGS.
JUST  IMAGINE THAT THE  KITTEN YOU PUT
IN THERE WILL GET SHREDDED.

HOW TO PLAY
YOU CAN ONLY PUT  ITEMS IN THE DEPOSIT
BOX THAT  ARE NOT  RELEVANT!  INTERACT
WITH THE OBJECTIVES  AT THE TOP TO PUT
ITEMS THERE!
(REMINDER: INTERACT WITH SPACEBAR)

WHAT TO DO NOW
YOU AND  THE OTHERS HEARD OF SOME EVIL
GUY WHO BUILT A MACHINE  THAT CAN MOVE
ANYTHING  TO /dev/null AND YOU NEED TO
STOP HIM!  GO NORTH. ITS  PROBABLY THE
CORRECT WAY

DISCLAIMER
No   cats  were   harmed  during   the
production of this game.
