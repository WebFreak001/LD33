Theme: You are the Monster

* 2D Top down
* You can carry up to 3 items (cats, garbage, quest items)
* There is an evil deposit store in each area where you can store your evil items, just because!
* Evil Items are marked red
* Epic plot twist
-> * Typical movie plot: Everyone is fighting against the evil guy but then it turns out he was the good guy and you were bad
* Because you were bad all along, you need to do bad things without them noticing for no reason at all
* Monster theme:
-> * You capture kittens while running around (+20 evil)
-> * You throw paper in the plastic bin (+2 evil)
-> * You throw batteries in the regular bin (+3 evil)
-> * You enter the opposite genders toilet and take a dump (+5 evil)
-> * You swear in front of children (+5 evil)
-> * You enter "staff only" sections for at least 3 seconds (+8 evil)

* You need to move around in a group through various locations
* There is a bar for getting seen doing bad things and one for being satisfied doing bad things
* Making one of them go down to 0 means game over
* 4 Levels, each getting harder

"Bad" guy is making weird contraptions that seem to be capable to move the world to /dev/null
He is actually just using it to get rid of the flies in his house.

Good guys + you want to stop him and are blocked by various things.

Level 1: Group is in a market and needs to get over the river. You need the following items to speed up building the bridge,
or you wait 2 months irl: (Kinda a tutorial of game mechanics)
- A Sandwich - acquired by talking to the sandwich guy
- Wood - acquired in the wood store (you need money first)
- Nails - acquired in the nail store (for reasons, you need money first)
- String - found near a bunch of cats

Level 2: Group is in a forest with a lumberjack that is willing to help them if you get these items for him:
- A Sandwich - acquired by finding some ingredients (you cant go back because the bridge collapsed)
- A new axe - acquired by entering konami code OR by polishing his old axe without him noticing
- A stick - you cant break off sticks of trees because everyone else in the group is a tree lover. There are no sticks on the
floor either.

Level 3: Group is at the entry of the fort by the "bad" guy, which is watched by a guy. To get past him you need:
- A Sandwich to distract the guy and get past.
- Lubricant so the floor does not make a noise when going over.
- An oven glove because the door handle is too hot to use by hand.

Level 4: Group is at the bad guys /dev/null machine. Suddenly the "bad" guy comes in and you need the following items to escape:
- A Sandwich - One of your mates cant run because he is very hungry. This should obviously help instantly.
  However one sandwich is not correct because it has tomatoes and he doesnt like tomatoes.
- A rope / cables - Because the fort is obviously at a very high point where its hard to get down you need some type of rope
  (Obtained from the /dev/null machine)
- Some thing to distract the "bad" guy because you cant search the other stuff while he is watching. But he will obviously
  wait until you distract him, and be exactly that long distracted as you search the other stuff but then magically no longer

Every time you buy a sandwich the character says: "We probably dont need more than one"


After level 1:
Bridge is collapsing just after you went over it.

After level 2:
Lumberjack shows way to the castle. The player could always see where it is just the characters were too stupid to walk
there because of a invisible wall

After level 3:
Walking all these stairs gets the group fatigued.

After level 4:
Everyone is on the way down, except for you when you cut the rope, let them die and throw the "bad" guy out of the window.
However they all survive the 50m deep fall because there is a huge marshmallow at the bottom.

All points from doing bad stuff before now get counted.
